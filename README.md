Ethercalc is a mult-user spreadsheet application similar to google calc.

This docker container installs ethercalc into an Alpine-based container using mhart's alpine-node:7.7 image.

The dockerfile itself is similar to the official one at https://hub.docker.com/r/audreyt/ethercalc/. See that for more information and documentation.
